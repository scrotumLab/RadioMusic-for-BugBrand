# RadioMusic-for-BugBrand-FRAC
With the permission of Tom Whitwell (Music Thing Modular), creator of the original Radio Music module, Scrotum Lab made different versions compatible with the BugBrand Modular System in FRAC format.

Here you will find the code which was changed to allow mixing & attenuation to the circuit and works on v3.x versions of the Scrotum Lab module (not the earlier versions which still use the original Music Thing Modular code).

As the main purpose of the Scrotum Lab Radio Music was to be used as a sample player, the main markings on the front panel were changed.<br>
"Station" became "Sample Select" / "Start" became "Pitch" / "Reset" became "Trig".

Instead of 3.5mm plugs, banana plugs are used like the ones found on the BugBrand system.<br>
• 2 x CV inputs were added to mix/attenuate the incoming signal at "Sample Select" and "Pitch" inputs.<br> 
• These CV inputs now accept bipolar signal -5V/+5V or unipolar +10V.<br> 
• Mostly all through hole components were replaced by SMD components (0805).<br>
